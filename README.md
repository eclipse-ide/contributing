# 🚀 Contributor Feedback Hub 🚀

Hey there, welcome to the Contributor Feedback Hub! 👋  

We created this repo so you can share your feedback, ask questions, and showcase your work as you contribute to the Eclipse's projects. By keeping everything in one place, we can learn from your experiences and make the contribution process smoother for everyone. So from now on, if you’ve got questions or feedback, drop it here! 🙌

Here’s how you can use this repo:

### 🌟 How to Use This Repo 🌟

1. **🐞 Report Issues with the Contribution Process**  
   Found a bug or hit a snag while setting things up or pushing a PR? Open an **[Issue](https://github.com/eclipse-ide/contributing/issues)** here to tell us what went wrong, whether it’s about installation, tooling, or submitting a PR. We’ll try to fix it and make things better! But, if you are fixing an existing bug in any project, use the project's issues system instead.
   

3. **🎉 Show Off Your Work in ‘Show and Tell’**  
   Share what you’ve built in the **[Discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-ide/contributing/discussions)** section under the ‘[Show and Tell](https://github.com/eclipse-ide/contributing/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)’ category! Describe what you did, how you did it, and any cool tricks you used along the way. This is your space to shine! ✨
   

5. **❓ Ask Questions in Q&A**  
   Stuck on something? Whether it’s about pushing a contribution or finding the right info, drop your question in the **[Q&A](https://github.com/eclipse-ide/contributing/discussions/categories/q-a)** category. We’re here to help you troubleshoot and keep things moving smoothly! 💪
